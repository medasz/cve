### Description

The WP Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the setup_page function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to run the setup wizard (if it has not been run previously) and access plugin configuration options.
