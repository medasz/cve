### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: target: Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crashIn newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit that indicates thereis no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commandslike "sg_write_same --ndob" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file'sexecute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sgbecause its NULL.This patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME codebecause we don't support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements ineach handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME withno data buffer.
