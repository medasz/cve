### Description

SVG <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> tags that referenced a same-origin document could have resulted in script execution if attacker input was sanitized via the HTML Sanitizer API. This would have required the attacker to reference a same-origin JavaScript file containing the script to be executed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102.
