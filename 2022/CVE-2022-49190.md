### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:kernel/resource: fix kfree() of bootmem memory againSince commit ebff7d8f270d ("mem hotunplug: fix kfree() of bootmemmemory"), we could get a resource allocated during boot viaalloc_resource().  And it's required to release the resource usingfree_resource().  Howerver, many people use kfree directly which willresult in kernel BUG.  In order to fix this without fixing every callsite, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.
