### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/ksm: fix race with VMA iteration and mm_struct teardownexit_mmap() will tear down the VMAs and maple tree with the mmap_lock heldin write mode.  Ensure that the maple tree is still valid by checkingksm_test_exit() after taking the mmap_lock in read mode, but before thefor_each_vma() iterator dereferences a destroyed maple tree.Since the maple tree is destroyed, the flags telling lockdep to check anexternal lock has been cleared.  Skip the for_each_vma() iterator to avoiddereferencing a maple tree without the external lock flag, which wouldcreate a lockdep warning.
