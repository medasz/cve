### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:hwmon: (coretemp) Simplify platform device handlingCoretemp's platform driver is unconventional. All the real work is doneglobally by the initcall and CPU hotplug notifiers, while the "driver"effectively just wraps an allocation and the registration of the hwmoninterface in a long-winded round-trip through the driver core.  The wholelogic of dynamically creating and destroying platform devices to bringthe interfaces up and down is error prone, since it assumesplatform_device_add() will synchronously bind the driver and set drvdatabefore it returns, thus results in a NULL dereference if drivers_autoprobeis turned off for the platform bus. Furthermore, the unusual approach ofdoing that from within a CPU hotplug notifier, already commented in thecode that it deadlocks suspend, also causes lockdep issues for otherdrivers or subsystems which may want to legitimately register a CPUhotplug notifier from a platform bus notifier.All of these issues can be solved by ripping this unusual behaviour outcompletely, simply tying the platform devices to the lifetime of themodule itself, and directly managing the hwmon interfaces from thehotplug notifiers. There is a slight user-visible change in that/sys/bus/platform/drivers/coretemp will no longer appear, and/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.n will remain present if package n ishotplugged off, but hwmon users should really only be looking for thepresence of the hwmon interfaces, whose behaviour remains unchanged.
