### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cifs: Release folio lock on fscache read hit.Under the current code, when cifs_readpage_worker is called, the callcontract is that the callee should unlock the page. This is documentedin the read_folio section of Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst as:> The filesystem should unlock the folio once the read has completed,> whether it was successful or not.Without this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs duringa read, the page lock is leaked, producing the following stack onsubsequent reads (via mmap) to the page:$ cat /proc/3890/task/12864/stack[<0>] folio_wait_bit_common+0x124/0x350[<0>] filemap_read_folio+0xad/0xf0[<0>] filemap_fault+0x8b1/0xab0[<0>] __do_fault+0x39/0x150[<0>] do_fault+0x25c/0x3e0[<0>] __handle_mm_fault+0x6ca/0xc70[<0>] handle_mm_fault+0xe9/0x350[<0>] do_user_addr_fault+0x225/0x6c0[<0>] exc_page_fault+0x84/0x1b0[<0>] asm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30This requires a reboot to resolve; it is a deadlock.Note however that the call to cifs_readpage_from_fscache does mark thepage clean, but does not free the folio lock. This happens in__cifs_readpage_from_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at thatpoint however is not appropriate as cifs_readahead also callscifs_readpage_from_fscache and *does* unconditionally release the lockafter its return. This change therefore effectively makescifs_readpage_worker work like cifs_readahead.
