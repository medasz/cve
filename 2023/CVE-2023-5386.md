### Description

The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the fnsf_delete_posts function in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts, including administrator posts, and posts not related to the Funnelforms Free plugin.
