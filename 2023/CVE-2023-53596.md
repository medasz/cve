### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drivers: base: Free devm resources when unregistering a deviceIn the current code, devres_release_all() only gets called if the devicehas a bus and has been probed.This leads to issues when using bus-less or driver-less devices wherethe device might never get freed if a managed resource holds a referenceto the device. This is happening in the DRM framework for example.We should thus call devres_release_all() in the device_del() function tomake sure that the device-managed actions are properly executed when thedevice is unregistered, even if it has neither a bus nor a driver.This is effectively the same change than commit 2f8d16a996da ("devres:release resources on device_del()") that got reverted by commita525a3ddeaca ("driver core: free devres in device_release") overmemory leaks concerns.This patch effectively combines the two commits mentioned above torelease the resources both on device_del() and device_release() and getthe best of both worlds.
