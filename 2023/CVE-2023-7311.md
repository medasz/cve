### Description

BYTEVALUE Intelligent Flow Control Router contains a command injection vulnerability via the /goform/webRead/open endpoint. The `path` parameter is not properly validated and is echoed into a shell context, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the device. Successful exploitation can lead to writing backdoors, privilege escalation on the host, and full compromise of the router and its management functions. VulnCheck has observed this vulnerability being targeted by the RondoDox botnet campaign.
