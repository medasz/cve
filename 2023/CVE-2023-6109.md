### Description

The YOP Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a race condition in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.26. This is due to improper restrictions on the add() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to place multiple votes on a single poll even when the poll is set to one vote per person.
