### Description

SmartBI V8, V9, and V10 contain an unrestricted file upload vulnerability via the RMIServlet request handling logic. Under certain configurations or usage patterns, attackers can send specially crafted requests that cause the application to perform sensitive operations or execute arbitrary code on the host. The vendor released a fix in July 2023 to address the underlying flaw.Â VulnCheck has observed this vulnerability being targeted by the Rondo botnet.
