### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ksmbd: call rcu_barrier() in ksmbd_server_exit()racy issue is triggered the bug by racing between closing a connectionand rmmod. In ksmbd, rcu_barrier() is not called at module unload time,so nothing prevents ksmbd from getting unloaded while it still has RCUcallbacks pending. It leads to trigger unintended execution of kernelcode locally and use to defeat protections such as Kernel Lockdown
