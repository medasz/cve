### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix potential UAF of struct nilfs_sc_info in nilfs_segctor_thread()The finalization of nilfs_segctor_thread() can race withnilfs_segctor_kill_thread() which terminates that thread, potentiallycausing a use-after-free BUG as KASAN detected.At the end of nilfs_segctor_thread(), it assigns NULL to "sc_task" memberof "struct nilfs_sc_info" to indicate the thread has finished, and thennotifies nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() of this using waitqueue"sc_wait_task" on the struct nilfs_sc_info.However, here, immediately after the NULL assignment to "sc_task", it ispossible that nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() will detect it and return tocontinue the deallocation, freeing the nilfs_sc_info structure before thethread does the notification.This fixes the issue by protecting the NULL assignment to "sc_task" andits notification, with spinlock "sc_state_lock" of the structnilfs_sc_info.  Since nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() does a final check tosee if "sc_task" is NULL with "sc_state_lock" locked, this can eliminatethe race.
