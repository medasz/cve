### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index itemInstead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index iteminto the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources wehave allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This isfine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done beforecalling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pendingsnapshots in the transaction commit path).So remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.This relates to a syzbot report linked below, but does not fix it becauseit only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where somehowwe attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.
