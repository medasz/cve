### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref[BUG]Syzbot reported several warning triggered insidelookup_inline_extent_backref().[CAUSE]As usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but atleast we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can notbe found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e.inserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should alreadyexist)[ENHANCEMENT]After the WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent treeleaf to help debug.
