### Description

ZKTeco BioTime version 8.5.5 through 9.0.1 allows authenticated attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the server by making specially crafted requests to '/base/sftpsetting/' endpoints that abuse a path traversal issue in the 'Username' field and a lack of input sanitization on the 'SSH Key' field. Overwriting specific files may lead to arbitrary code execution as the 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' user.
