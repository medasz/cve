### Description

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in survey titles of REDCap 14.9.6 allows authenticated users to inject malicious scripts into the Survey Title field or Survey Instructions. When a user receives a survey and clicks anywhere on the survey page to enter data, the crafted payload (which has been injected into all survey fields) is executed, potentially enabling the execution of arbitrary web scripts.
