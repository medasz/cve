### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dai: Ensure DAI widget is valid during paramsEach cpu DAI should associate with a widget. However, the topology mightnot create the right number of DAI widgets for aggregated amps. And itwill cause NULL pointer deference.Check that the DAI widget associated with the CPU DAI is valid to preventNULL pointer deference due to missing DAI widgets in topologies withaggregated amps.
