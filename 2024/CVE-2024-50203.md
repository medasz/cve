### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf, arm64: Fix address emission with tag-based KASAN enabledWhen BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is enabled, the address of a bpf_tramp_imagestruct on the stack is passed during the size calculation pass andan address on the heap is passed during code generation. This maycause a heap buffer overflow if the heap address is tagged becauseemit_a64_mov_i64() will emit longer code than it did during the sizecalculation pass. The same problem could occur without tag-basedKASAN if one of the 16-bit words of the stack address happened tobe all-ones during the size calculation pass. Fix the problem byassuming the worst case (4 instructions) when calculating the sizeof the bpf_tramp_image address emission.
