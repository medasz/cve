### Description

The Happy Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to insufficient authorization on the duplicate_thing() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.4. This makes it possible for attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to clone arbitrary posts (including private and password protected ones) which may lead to information exposure.
