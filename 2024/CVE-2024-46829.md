In thegood case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits awarning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, whichtriggers the 'scheduling in atomic' warning.Unlock rt_mutex::wait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warningand dropping into the schedule for ever loop.[ tglx: Moved unlock before the WARN(), removed the pointless comment,  	massaged changelog, added Fixes tag ]
