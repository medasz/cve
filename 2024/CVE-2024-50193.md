### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/entry_32: Clear CPU buffers after register restore in NMI returnCPU buffers are currently cleared after call to exc_nmi, but beforeregister state is restored. This may be okay for MDS mitigation but not forRDFS. Because RDFS mitigation requires CPU buffers to be cleared whenregisters don't have any sensitive data.Move CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS after RESTORE_ALL_NMI.
