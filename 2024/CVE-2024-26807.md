### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Both cadence-quadspi ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume()implementations start with:	struct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);	struct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);This obviously cannot be correct, unless "struct cqspi_st" is thefirst member of " struct spi_controller", or the other way around, butit is not the case. "struct spi_controller" is allocated bydevm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates an extra amount of memory forprivate data, used to store "struct cqspi_st".The ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets thedevice drvdata to store the address of the "struct cqspi_st"structure. Therefore:	struct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);is correct, but:	struct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);is not, as it makes "host" point not to a "struct spi_controller" butto the same "struct cqspi_st" structure as above.This obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes)directly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PMruntime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which inturns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.This has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but theexact behavior will depend on the memory contents.[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240226121803.5a7r5wkpbbowcxgx@dhruva/This issue potentially affects all platforms that are currently usingthe cadence-quadspi driver.
