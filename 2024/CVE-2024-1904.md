### Description

The MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the search_posts function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to expose draft post titles and excerpts.
