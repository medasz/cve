### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/v3d: Stop active perfmon if it is being destroyedIf the active performance monitor (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is beingdestroyed, stop it first. Currently, the active perfmon is notstopped during destruction, leaving the `v3d->active_perfmon` pointerstale. This can lead to undefined behavior and instability.This patch ensures that the active perfmon is stopped before beingdestroyed, aligning with the behavior introduced in commit7d1fd3638ee3 ("drm/v3d: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed").
