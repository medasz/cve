### Description

The Buddyboss Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘invitee_name’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.50 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.41.
