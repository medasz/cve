### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:staging: iio: frequency: ad9832: fix division by zero in ad9832_calc_freqreg()In the ad9832_write_frequency() function, clk_get_rate() might return 0.This can lead to a division by zero when calling ad9832_calc_freqreg().The check if (fout > (clk_get_rate(st->mclk) / 2)) does not protectagainst the case when fout is 0. The ad9832_write_frequency() functionis called from ad9832_write(), and fout is derived from a text buffer,which can contain any value.
