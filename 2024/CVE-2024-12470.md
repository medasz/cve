### Description

The School Management System â€“ SakolaWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to the registration function not properly limiting what roles a user can register as. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrative user.
