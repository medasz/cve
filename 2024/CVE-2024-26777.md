### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fbdev: sis: Error out if pixclock equals zeroThe userspace program could pass any values to the driver throughioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't check the value of pixclock,it may cause divide-by-zero error.In sisfb_check_var(), var->pixclock is used as a divisor to caculatedrate before it is checked against zero. Fix this by checking itat the beginning.This is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed bycommit 15cf0b8.
