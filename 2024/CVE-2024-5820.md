### Description

An unprotected WebSocket connection in the latest version of stitionai/devika (commit ecee79f) allows a malicious website to connect to the backend and issue commands on behalf of the user. The backend serves all listeners on the given socket, enabling any such malicious website to intercept all communication between the user and the backend. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized command execution and potential server-side request forgery.
