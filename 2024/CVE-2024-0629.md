### Description

The 2Checkout Payment Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the sniff_ins function in all versions up to, and including, 6.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make changes to orders and mark them as paid.
