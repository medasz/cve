### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_paramIn the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section isunlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing thispointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memorythat has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developedby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field isthen assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value issafely accessed.
