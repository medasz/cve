### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: nl80211: reject iftype change with mesh ID changeIt's currently possible to change the mesh ID when theinterface isn't yet in mesh mode, at the same time aschanging it into mesh mode. This leads to an overwriteof data in the wdev->u union for the interface type itcurrently has, causing cfg80211_change_iface() to dowrong things when switching.We could probably allow setting an interface to meshwhile setting the mesh ID at the same time by doing adifferent order of operations here, but realisticallythere's no userspace that's going to do this, so justdisallow changes in iftype when setting mesh ID.
