### Description

The Leagoo P1 Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c_1h10_32v4_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a hidden root privilege escalation capability to achieve command execution as the root user. They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB by modifying read-only system properties at runtime. Specifically, modifying the ro.debuggable and the ro.secure system properties to a certain value and then restarting the ADB daemon allows for a root shell to be obtained via ADB.
