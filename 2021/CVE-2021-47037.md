### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driverQ6afe-clocks driver can get reprobed. For example if the APR servicesare restarted after the firmware crash. However currently Q6afe-clocksdriver will oops because hw.init will get cleared during first _probecall. Rewrite the driver to fill the clock data at runtime rather thanusing big static array of clocks.
