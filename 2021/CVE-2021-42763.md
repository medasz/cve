### Description

Couchbase Server before 6.6.3 and 7.x before 7.0.2 stores Sensitive Information in Cleartext. The issue occurs when the cluster manager forwards a HTTP request from the pluggable UI (query workbench etc) to the specific service. In the backtrace, the Basic Auth Header included in the HTTP request, has the "@" user credentials of the node processing the UI request.
