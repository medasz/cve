### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: fix another slab-out-of-bounds in fib6_nh_flush_exceptionsWhile running the self-tests on a KASAN enabled kernel, I observed aslab-out-of-bounds splat very similar to the one reported incommit 821bbf79fe46 ("ipv6: Fix KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions").We additionally need to take care of fib6_metrics initializationfailure when the caller provides an nh.The fix is similar, explicitly free the route instead of callingfib6_info_release on a half-initialized object.
