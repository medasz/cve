### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm rq: don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspendDM uses blk-mq's quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue.But blk-mq's unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevatorswitch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come duringsuspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests anddm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.
