### Description

The Inspiro theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the inspiro_install_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install plugins from the repository via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
