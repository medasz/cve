### Description

Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remoterecovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bitARM platforms.Impact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bitARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..While remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,timing measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.OpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and sothis CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it ispossible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupledwith the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may berecoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderateseverity issue.The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by thisissue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.
