### Description

The WP SinoType plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the sinotype_config function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify typography settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
