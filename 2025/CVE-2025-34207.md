### Description

Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to 22.0.1049 and Application prior to 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) configure the SSH client within Docker instances with the following options: `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, and `ForwardAgent yes`.  These settings disable verification of the remote host’s SSH key and automatically forward the developer’s SSH‑agent to any host that matches the configured wildcard patterns.  As a result, an attacker who can reach a single compromised container can cause the container to connect to a malicious SSH server, capture the forwarded private keys, and use those keys for unrestricted lateral movement across the environment. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-027 — Insecure Secure Shell (SSH) Configuration.
