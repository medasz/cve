### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc treenetem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netemresides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to asoft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with othernetems.Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Consideredtoo specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this wouldbe a resilient fix and address other previous and potential futureDOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with aper cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on itschild, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is anetem.3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cbto handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvementin duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamalnotes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent thissafeguard.4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestralpath contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause apacket to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netemduplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent aduplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/8DuRWwfqjoRDLDmBMlIfbrsZg9Gx50DHJc1ilxsEBNe2D6NMoigR_eIRIG0LOjMc3r10nUUZtArXx4oZBIdUfZQrwjcQhdinnMis_0G7VEk=@willsroot.io/[2] https://lwn.net/Articles/719297/
