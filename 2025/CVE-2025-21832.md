### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: don't revert iter for -EIOCBQUEUEDblkdev_read_iter() has a few odd checks, like gating the position andcount adjustment on whether or not the result is bigger-than-or-equal tozero (where bigger than makes more sense), and not checking the returnvalue of blkdev_direct_IO() before doing an iov_iter_revert(). Thelatter can lead to attempting to revert with a negative value, whichwhen passed to iov_iter_revert() as an unsigned value will lead tothrowing a WARN_ON() because unroll is bigger than MAX_RW_COUNT.Be sane and don't revert for -EIOCBQUEUED, like what is done in otherspots.
