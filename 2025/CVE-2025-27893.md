### Description

In Archer Platform 6 through 6.14.00202.10024, an authenticated user with record creation privileges can manipulate immutable fields, such as the creation date, by intercepting and modifying a Copy request via a GenericContent/Record.aspx?id= URI. This enables unauthorized modification of system-generated metadata, compromising data integrity and potentially impacting auditing, compliance, and security controls.
