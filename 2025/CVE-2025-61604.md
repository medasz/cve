### Description

WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on charitable institutions. Versions 3.4.12 and below contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The delete operation for the Almoxarifado entity is exposed via HTTP GET without CSRF protection, allowing a third-party site to trigger the action using the victimâ€™s authenticated session. This issue is fixed in version 3.5.0.
