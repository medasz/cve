### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: ets: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdiscAs described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netemchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.In the case of ets, there won't be a UAF, but the code will add the sameclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.In addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whetherthe class was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) beforedoing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/
