### Description

The Reolink Desktop Application 8.18.12 contains hardcoded credentials as the Initialization Vector (IV) in its AES-CFB encryption implementation allowing attackers with access to the application environment to reliably decrypt encrypted configuration data. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that material is not hardcoded and is instead randomly generated on each installation of the application.
