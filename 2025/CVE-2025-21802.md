### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: hns3: fix oops when unload drivers parallelingWhen unload hclge driver, it tries to disable sriov first for eachae_dev node from hnae3_ae_dev_list. If user unloads hns3 driver atthe time, because it removes all the ae_dev nodes, and it may causeoops.But we can't simply use hnae3_common_lock for this. Because in theprocess flow of pci_disable_sriov(), it will trigger the remove flowof VF, which will also take hnae3_common_lock.To fixes it, introduce a new mutex to protect the unload process.
