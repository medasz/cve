### Description

** DISPUTED ** A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in HDF5 1.14.6. This affects the function H5Z__scaleoffset_decompress_one_byte of the component Scale-Offset Filter. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The vendor was contacted early about a batch of vulnerabilities. His response was "reject" without further explanation. We have not received an elaboration even after asking politely for further details. Currently we assume that the vendor wants to "dispute" the entries which is why they are flagged as such until further details become available.
