### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/amd: Fix potential buffer overflow in parse_ivrs_acpihidThere is a string parsing logic error which can lead to an overflow of hidor uid buffers. Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn'ttake into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so thecheck is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hidstring is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of strwill be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid bufferwhich size is 256.The same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string withlength 250.Check the length of hid and uid strings separately to preventbuffer overflow.Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
