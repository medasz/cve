### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:powerpc/eeh: Make EEH driver device hotplug safeMultiple race conditions existed between the PCIe hotplug driver and theEEH driver, leading to a variety of kernel oopses of the same generalnature:<pcie device unplug><eeh driver trigger><hotplug removal trigger><pcie tree reconfiguration><eeh recovery next step><oops in EEH driver bus iteration loop>A second class of oops is also seen when the underlying bus disappearsduring device recovery.Refactor the EEH module to be PCI rescan and remove safe.  Also cleanup a few minor formatting / readability issues.
