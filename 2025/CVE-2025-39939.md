### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iommu/s390: Fix memory corruption when using identity domainzpci_get_iommu_ctrs() returns counter information to be reported as partof device statistics; these counters are stored as part of the s390_domain.The problem, however, is that the identity domain is not backed by ans390_domain and so the conversion via to_s390_domain() yields a bad addressthat is zero'd initially and read on-demand later via a sysfs read.These counters aren't necessary for the identity domain; just return NULLin this case.This issue was discovered via KASAN with reports that look like:BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in zpci_fmb_enable_devicewhen using the identity domain for a device on s390.
