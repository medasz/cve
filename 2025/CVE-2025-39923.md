### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix DT error handling for num-channels/eesWhen we don't have a clock specified in the device tree, we have no way toensure the BAM is on. This is often the case for remotely-controlled orremotely-powered BAM instances. In this case, we need to read num-channelsfrom the DT to have all the necessary information to complete probing.However, at the moment invalid device trees without clock and withoutnum-channels still continue probing, because the error handling is missingreturn statements. The driver will then later try to read the number ofchannels from the registers. This is unsafe, because it relies on bootfirmware and lucky timing to succeed. Unfortunately, the lack of propererror handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,causing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].Avoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DTproperties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTsupstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,clearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in thekernel log was just ignored. It's safer to disable the crypto engine forthese broken DTBs.[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CY01EKQVWE36.B9X5TDXAREPF@fairphone.com/[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230626145959.646747-1-krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org/
