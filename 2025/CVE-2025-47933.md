### Description

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.13.8, 2.14.13, and 3.0.4, an attacker can perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API. Due to the improper filtering of URL protocols in the repository page, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with permission to edit the repository. This issue has been patched in versions 2.13.8, 2.14.13, and 3.0.4.
