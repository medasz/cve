### Description

The MPWizard â€“ Create Mercado Pago Payment Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the '/includes/admin/class-mpwizard-table.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
