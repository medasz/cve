### Description

Improper handling of symbolic links in the TeamViewer Full Client and Host for Windows — in versions prior to 15.70 of TeamViewer Remote and Tensor — allows an attacker with local, unprivileged access to a device lacking adequate malware protection to escalate privileges by spoofing the update file path. This may result in unauthorized access to sensitive information.
