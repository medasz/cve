### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf, ktls: Fix data corruption when using bpf_msg_pop_data() in ktlsWhen sending plaintext data, we initially calculated the correspondingciphertext length. However, if we later reduced the plaintext data lengthvia socket policy, we failed to recalculate the ciphertext length.This results in transmitting buffers containing uninitialized data duringciphertext transmission.This causes uninitialized bytes to be appended after a complete"Application Data" packet, leading to errors on the receiving end whenparsing TLS record.
