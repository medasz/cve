### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:libceph: fix invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_infoThere is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading andanother place where it is writing to con->v1 union member withoutchecking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter,so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because theside effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successivefetching of new tickets.con->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact thatit's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckilyit's not something that happens often.
