### Description

Notepad++ v8.8.3 has a DLL hijacking vulnerability, which can replace the original DLL file to execute malicious code. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because the behavior only occurs when a user installs the product into a directory tree that allows write access by arbitrary unprivileged users.
