### Description

A logic error exists in the Falcon sensor for Windows that could allow an attacker, with the prior ability to execute code on a host, to delete arbitrary files. CrowdStrike released a security fix for this issue in Falcon sensor for Windows versions 7.24 and above and all Long Term Visibility (LTV) sensors.There is no indication of exploitation of these issues in the wild. Our threat hunting and intelligence teams are actively monitoring for exploitation and we maintain visibility into any such attempts.The Falcon sensor for Mac, the Falcon sensor for Linux and the Falcon sensor for Legacy Systems are not impacted by this.CrowdStrike was made aware of this issue through our HackerOne bug bounty program. It was discovered by Cong Cheng and responsibly disclosed.
