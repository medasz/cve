### Description

Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049 and Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA/SaaS deployments) expose internal Docker containers through the gw Docker instance.  The gateway publishes a /meta endpoint which lists every micro‑service container together with version information. These containers are reachable directly over HTTP/HTTPS without any access‑control list (ACL), authentication or rate‑limiting. Consequently, any attacker on the LAN or the Internet can enumerate all internal services and their versions, interact with the exposed APIs of each microservice as an unauthenticated user, or issue malicious requests that may lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation within the container, or denial‑of‑service of the entire appliance. The root cause is the absence of authentication and network‑level restrictions on the API‑gateway’s proxy to internal Docker containers, effectively turning the internal service mesh into a public attack surface. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-030 — Exposed Internal Docker Instance (LAN).
