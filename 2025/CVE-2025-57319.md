### Description

fast-redact is a package that provides do very fast object redaction. A Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the nestedRestore function of fast-redact version 3.5.0 and before allows attackers to inject properties on Object.prototype via supplying a crafted payload, causing denial of service (DoS) as the minimum consequence. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this because the reporter only demonstrated access to properties by an internal utility function, and there is no means for achieving prototype pollution via the public API.
