### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()object_err() reports details of an object for further debugging, such asthe freelist pointer, redzone, etc. However, if the pointer is invalid,attempting to access object metadata can lead to a crash since it doesnot point to a valid object.One known path to the crash is when alloc_consistency_checks()determines the pointer to the allocated object is invalid because of afreelist corruption, and calls object_err() to report it. The debug codeshould report and handle the corruption gracefully and not crash in theprocess.In case the pointer is NULL or check_valid_pointer() returns false forthe pointer, only print the pointer value and skip accessing metadata.
