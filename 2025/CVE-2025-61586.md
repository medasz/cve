### Description

FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Versions 1.26.3 and below are vulnerable to directory enumeration by setting path in theme field, allowing attackers to gain additional information about the server by checking if certain directories exist. This issue is fixed in version 1.27.0.
