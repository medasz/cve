### Description

Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Versions prior to 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 are vulnerable to Command Line Injection attacks on Windows when batch files are executed. In Windows, ``CreateProcess()`` always implicitly spawns ``cmd.exe`` if a batch file (.bat, .cmd, etc.) is being executed even if the application does not specify it via the command line. This makes Deno vulnerable to a command injection attack on Windows. Versions 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 fix the issue.
