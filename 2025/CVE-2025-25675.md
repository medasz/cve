### Description

Tenda AC10 V1.0 V15.03.06.23 has a command injection vulnerablility located in the formexeCommand function. The str variable receives the cmdinput parameter from a POST request and is later assigned to the cmd_buf variable, which is directly used in the doSystemCmd function, causing an arbitrary command execution.
