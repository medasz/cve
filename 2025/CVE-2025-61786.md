### Description

Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In versions prior to 2.5.3 and 2.2.15, `Deno.FsFile.prototype.stat` and `Deno.FsFile.prototype.statSync` are not limited by the permission model check `--deny-read=./`. It's possible to retrieve stats from files that the user do not have explicit read access to (the script is executed with `--deny-read=./`). Similar APIs like `Deno.stat` and `Deno.statSync` require `allow-read` permission, however, when a file is opened, even with file-write only flags and deny-read permission, it's still possible to retrieve file stats, and thus bypass the permission model. Versions 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 fix the issue.
