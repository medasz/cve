### Description

The Slider Revolution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.37. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to install and activate plugin add-ons, create sliders, and download arbitrary files.
