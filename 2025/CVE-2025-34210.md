### Description

Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (VA/SaaS deployments) store a large number of sensitive credentials (database passwords, MySQL root password, SaaS keys, Portainer admin password, etc.) in cleartext files that are world-readable. Any local user - or any process that can read the host filesystem - can retrieve all of these secrets in plain text, leading to credential theft and full compromise of the appliance. The vendor does not consider this to be a security vulnerability as this product "follows a shared responsibility model, where administrators are expected to configure persistent storage encryption."
