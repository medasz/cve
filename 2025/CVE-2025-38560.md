### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/sev: Evict cache lines during SNP memory validationAn SNP cache coherency vulnerability requires a cache line evictionmitigation when validating memory after a page state change to private.The specific mitigation is to touch the first and last byte of each 4Kpage that is being validated. There is no need to perform the mitigationwhen performing a page state change to shared and rescinding validation.CPUID bit Fn8000001F_EBX[31] defines the COHERENCY_SFW_NO CPUID bitthat, when set, indicates that the software mitigation for thisvulnerability is not needed.Implement the mitigation and invoke it when validating memory (making itprivate) and the COHERENCY_SFW_NO bit is not set, indicating the SNPguest is vulnerable.
