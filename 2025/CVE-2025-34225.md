### Description

Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102 and Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The `console_release` directory is reachable from the internet without any authentication.  Inside that directory are dozens of PHP scripts that build URLs from user‑controlled values and then invoke either 'curl_exec()` or `file_get_contents()` without proper validation. Although many files attempt to mitigate SSRF by calling `filter_var', the checks are incomplete. Because the endpoint is unauthenticated, any remote attacker can supply a hostname and cause the server to issue requests to internal resources. This enables internal network reconnaissance, potential pivoting, or data exfiltration. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
