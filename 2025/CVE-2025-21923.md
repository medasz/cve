### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: hid-steam: Fix use-after-free when detaching deviceWhen a hid-steam device is removed it must clean up the client_hdev used forintercepting hidraw access. This can lead to scheduling deferred work toreattach the input device. Though the cleanup cancels the deferred work, thiswas done before the client_hdev itself is cleaned up, so it gets rescheduled.This patch fixes the ordering to make sure the deferred work is properlycanceled.
