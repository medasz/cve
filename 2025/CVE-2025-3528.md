### Description

A flaw was found in the Mirror Registry. The quay-app container shipped as part of the Mirror Registry for OpenShift has write access to the `/etc/passwd`. This flaw allows a malicious actor with access to the container to modify the passwd file and elevate their privileges to the root user within that pod.
