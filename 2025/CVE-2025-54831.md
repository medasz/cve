### Description

Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a "write-only" model for sensitive values.In Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.This issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.Users of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4.
