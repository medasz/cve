### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/sched: Increment job count before swapping tail spsc queueA small race exists between spsc_queue_push and the run-job worker, inwhich spsc_queue_push may return not-first while the run-job worker hasalready idled due to the job count being zero. If this race occurs, jobscheduling stops, leading to hangs while waiting on the jobâ€™s DMAfences.Seal this race by incrementing the job count before appending to theSPSC queue.This race was observed on a drm-tip 6.16-rc1 build with the Xe driver inan SVM test case.
