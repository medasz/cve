### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dmaengine: ti: edma: Fix memory allocation size for queue_priority_mapFix a critical memory allocation bug in edma_setup_from_hw() wherequeue_priority_map was allocated with insufficient memory. The codedeclared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8),but allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size.This caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing:  queue_priority_map[i][0] = i;  queue_priority_map[i][1] = i;The bug manifested as kernel crashes with "Oops - undefined instruction"on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as thememory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang.Change the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) whichautomatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure.
