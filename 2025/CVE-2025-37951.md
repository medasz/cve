### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skippedWhen a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the GPU has made any progresssince the last timeout. If so, instead of resetting the hardware, we skipthe reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs achance to complete.However, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removedfrom the pending list, which means it won't be automatically freed through`free_job()`. Consequently, when we skip the reset and keep the jobrunning, the job won't be freed when it finally completes.This situation leads to a memory leak, as exposed in [1] and [2].Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 ("drm/etnaviv: don't block scheduler whenGPU is still active"), this patch ensures the job is put back on thepending list when extending the timeout.
