### Description

The Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin settings change due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to change plugin settings related to things such as IP-blocking.
