### Description

The vulnerability allows an existing user to add playlists to a different userâ€™s channel using the PeerTube REST API. The vulnerable code sets the owner of the new playlist to be the user who performed the request, and then sets the associated channel to the channel ID supplied by the request, without checking if it belongs to the user.
