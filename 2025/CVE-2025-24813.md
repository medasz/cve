### Description

Path Equivalence: 'file.Name' (Internal Dot) leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Information disclosure and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98.If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads- attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded- the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUTIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution:- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)- application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the default storage location- application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attackUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.
