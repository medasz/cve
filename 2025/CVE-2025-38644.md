### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: mac80211: reject TDLS operations when station is not associatedsyzbot triggered a WARN in ieee80211_tdls_oper() by sendingNL80211_TDLS_ENABLE_LINK immediately after NL80211_CMD_CONNECT,before association completed and without prior TDLS setup.This left internal state like sdata->u.mgd.tdls_peer uninitialized,leading to a WARN_ON() in code paths that assumed it was valid.Reject the operation early if not in station mode or not associated.
