### Description

Anyquery is an SQL query engine built on top of SQLite. Versions 0.4.3 and below allow attackers who have already gained access to localhost, even with low privileges, to use the http server through the port unauthenticated, and access private integration data like emails, without any warning of a foreign login from the provider. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.4.
