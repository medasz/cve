### Description

A remotecode execution security issue exists in the Rockwell Automation Arena®.  A crafted DOEfile can force Arena Simulation to write beyond the boundaries of an allocatedobject. Exploitationrequires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file within the software.If exploited, a threat actor could execute arbitrary code on the target system.The software must run under the context of the administrator in order to causeworse case impact. This is reflected in the Rockwell CVSS score, as AT:P.
