### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registrationResolve kernel panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with thegenerated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing thecurrent interrupt state before handling the interrupt request usinggeneric_handle_irq.A previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' wasreplaced with 'handle_nested_irq'. However, this change also causesthe kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered theinterrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mappedIRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.
