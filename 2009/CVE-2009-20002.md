### Description

Millenium MP3 Studio versions up to and including 2.0 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing .pls playlist files. The application fails to properly validate the length of the File1 field within the playlist, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious .pls file that overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and executes arbitrary code. Exploitation requires the victim to open the file locally, though remote execution may be possible if the .pls extension is registered to the application and opened via a browser.
