### Description

AVTECH devices that include the CloudSetup.cgi management endpoint are vulnerable to authenticated OS command injection. The `exefile` parameter in CloudSetup.cgi is passed to the underlying system command execution without proper validation or whitelisting. An authenticated attacker who can invoke this endpoint can supply crafted input to execute arbitrary system commands as root. Successful exploitation grants full control of the device, and - depending on deployment and whether the device stores credentials or has network reachability to internal systems - may enable credential theft, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The archived SEARCH-LAB disclosure implies that this vulnerability was remediated in early 2017, but AVTECH has not defined an affected version range.
